I tried launching an online speed dating event, 48hrs before Valentines. I thought Tech would be hard part. Boy was I naive. 

TLDR; Waitlisting is a great idea for market feedback. Timing can be incredible boost. Distribution is the (and maybe only) problem to solve. Much more than tech.

## The Impulse (Origin Story)

So let me paint the scene. 12th Feb noon. "It's 2 days before valentines, no dates. What do i do? Speed dating. Eh who'll go tho. What abt online. Hey what if i can conduct this". 

## The Build 

Then talked to claude abt it, a few back forth later, cut it down into a very lean system ->
(1) Match users
(2) Use webrtc for direct conection, so users connected, no need for server for user chatting + no chats stored, so no legal drama.
(3) No profiles, no pics, only match, talk, vibe or dont vibe
(4) vibed? Exchange contacts, get out. Did not vibe? Back into matching. 2 hr event. 
(4) First userbase to cater small, just 100 people, 50:50 (boy was i naive), so hopefully 0 server costs. Also restricting to bangalore people.

Built a very quick, simple, direct to point waitlist signup website, designed by claude, amazing designer, designed for punchy looks and clear cut value proposition. Link is here https://adityaprasad275.github.io/bemyvalentinebg/ .
here a Key design decision that saved me was directly pushing data from the form to gsheets. No need to start a backend server for taking email. The leaner the tech, the better.

## Distribution Reality Check

Reddit vs Twitter. 

Reddit is more of a board. You post there, people who follow the board, see your post (if (1) post good (2) people interested in that topic).

In Twitter, you are the board. People who follow you, see your posts. Well something like that. My twitter following is pretty bad, and hence, no real engagement from their

So went ahead with Reddit. But what I didnt realise was my account was new, didnt had much karma. Well some boards/subreddits dont allow posting if you do not have karma. So a few subreddits that could have improved the marketing, I could simply not post in them. Also ofc, subreddits dont want to be bombarded with ads, so naturally they have rules to not allow posting. lol. 

## Early Traction (and Panic)

Turns out, post something abt dating, 2 days before valentines, people actually relate and care. Especially something that promises to cure dating? Dreams sure are great. 

In the first 2 hours, I got 30 male sign ups (les gooo) and 2 female sign ups (Yikes)

Paused men signups for a moment. Begged for people to share to women focused subreddits. NOT good for optics. 10 hours later, 10 women have signed up (Yaaaay but also oh no).

## User feedback

Here I am really grateful for the number of eyes this idea surfaced, because I got a lot of good feedback. Well two but still. And they both resonated with Quality Control

## Quality Control

See, the bare bones idea, bare bones marketing had zero quality control. I mean the idea was match, talk, vibe dont vibe. Speed, not quality. 

This was actually born out of a hate for swiping. See I dont fare well there (yup, sad). But I do like talking. So get me to talking! Hence this system. 

Welp, women dont (and this is a very gross generalisation I apologize) exactly do bad in swiping. Right. Their pain point is actually, the connections that you do get from dating apps, arent good. Fleeting, dont go anywhere. So, quality control. 

But quality is a subjective experience right. What I define as quality, you might not. So how do you buid for somethign like this? Well quite a few bad idea 

## Some amazingly Bad Solutions I Considered

(1) what if not just bangalore people. What if IIT + bangalore. Even more of a niche? Thats good right? Nope. Because (a) Very small TAM, forget 50:50 , 10:10 would be difficult. (b) Quality != Degree. Stupid thinking, I apologize.

(2) Make men signups costly, women sign up. It makes sense in that, well you'll filter out non serious people. Welp, actually, if you think abt it a bit more and this is hypothetical not market validated -> I paid for this so I demand/deserve attention from people -> Harrasment. 

## Realization: This isnt a feature problem

A little back and forth with people, ai and  a few things can be qualified as quality/Trust/Safety ->

(1) Norms/rules in community 
(2) No troll, no harrasment or better, moderation
(3) reputation. A system to report/rate. 

This is actually a community. A commmunity where every member is (hopefully) verified to be real person. People know how they interact, or have atleast some trust that its not compeletly random. This grp serves a base for actually promoting people to the speed dating event. 

## The Deeper Problem (Events vs Apps)

But let's just take a step back here. Online Speed dating? great idea. Lacking in trust so need to build that. Great reception! But is this reproducible? What if i want to do a speed dating event in say, a month? Would I be able to get 50:50 people again? Can i reproducibly do such marketing?

The problem is (1) The user has to be interested in idea to ever sign up (2) The user has to take 2 hrs or whatever time from their busy day and actually dedicate to this

My event better be the next apple product launch for people to take out time. But what if it was?

## The Seductive Fantasy

What if, the community felt gold/gated/great. getting selected in the speed dating event felt like you qualified something, a sense of pride, a sense of prestige. Apple product launches are that right? They repetedly do get a lot of people. Well that didnt build overnight. It took a them <however many years> to be a status symbol. And here we dive into Event vs Apps

## The Hidden Fragility of Events

Events feel exciting because they promise bursts of magic.
But they are fragile, perishable, and distribution-hungry every single time.

Apps, for all their flaws, compound. 

But they exist in an incredibly competitive arena. I mean you're literally competing with instagram for attention. User decides in seconds whether they want to stay on their app. 

This is where attention economics hits hard.

Paras Chopra uses the term MARL — marginally active user — describing them as a goldfish on acid with a one-second attention window. You better be the best. Retention, distribution and virality are the core survival mechanisms.

And this is where the illusion broke for me.

I wasn’t really building a speed dating system.
I was accidentally stepping into the hardest possible category: consumer social.

## Where This Leaves Me

The experiment didn’t become a product.

But it became a crash course in things I had only read about before:
distribution, trust, incentives, and how quickly reality humbles elegant ideas.

I went in thinking tech would be the hard part.
It wasn’t.

Getting attention, balancing a marketplace, and designing for human comfort turned out to be the real challenges.

Tech was just the implementation detail.

I still love the idea of fast, real conversations instead of endless swiping. Not the end.
Just… postponed until I understand humans better.
